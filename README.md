# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning with CampusX

Welcome to my personal repository for the [CampusX Machine Learning course](https://www.youtube.com/c/CampusX)! 
This repo contains notes, code, exercises, and projects based on the course as I progress through it.
The goal is to build a strong foundation in machine learning using Python, scikit-learn, and other essential tools.
